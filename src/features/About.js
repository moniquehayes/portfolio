        <p>I'm a former Geometry Teacher turned Full Stack Software Engineer with an eye for detail and a passion for collaborating with others. I've always loved math, logic, and problem solving. After taking on a part-time Operations role during my last year of teaching, I realized I also loved logistics and data, and I wanted to harness this newfound love as I looked to make a career shift. After exploring SQL through an online Cornell course, along with some phenomenal guidance from a mentor of mine, I decided that a Software Engineering bootcamp, and more specifically, the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, would be the perfect way to make this shift. Throughout the program I have loved discovering new languages and gaining the knowledge base to create full stack websites in just a few short months. I am most interested in Full Stack and Frontend Development roles. As I enter the job market, I am looking for a company that not only is working to make positive growth and change in the world, but furthermore is passionate about fostering community and growth amongst its employees.</p>
        <p>Please take a look at some of the projects I've done below!</p>
